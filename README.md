#GradHack

A comical roguelike based on graduate school

This uses classical vi keybindings. When on stairs use "." to ascend or descend. Pick up the thesis with "." as well. I'll eventually have one more key use for item useage when that gets implemented.

More specifically:

* h,j,k,l,y,u,b,n for movement (use it! the game should basically be impossible if you use arrow keys)
* 0, 1, 2 for special skills
* . for doing things that appear on screen (up/down stairs, use book, use item)

This is a very preliminary sketch of the final game. To run you will need pygame and python 3 (maybe earlier versions will work?). You do not need to make anything. Just type "python gradhack.py" in a terminal in the gradhack directory to run it.

## Note to pre-alpha testers:

There is no real way to win/lose yet, so ... experiment at your own risk. If you find clear bugs that you think I might not know about, I would be ever grateful if you told me.
