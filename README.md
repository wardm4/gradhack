##A comical roguelike based on graduate school

This uses classical vi keybindings. When on stairs use "." to ascend or descend. Pick up the thesis with "." as well. I'll eventually have one more key use for item useage when that gets implemented.

This is a very preliminary sketch of the final game. To run you will need pygame and python 3 (maybe earlier versions will work?). You do not need to make anything. Just type "python gradhack.py" in a terminal in the gradhack directory to run it.

## Note to pre-alpha testers:

There is no real way to win/lose yet, so ... experiment at your own risk. If you find clear bugs that you think I might not know about, I would be ever grateful if you told me.

## Notes to self:

The plan is to get rid of HP and instead only use time. When you run out of time/turns until your rival uploads your thesis and plagiarizes it as his own you lose. Getting hit by enemies will decrease time remaining, but destroying certain enemies will give you time back (the idea being that you "gain control" of the virus you killed and send it to your rivals computer which slows down his upload).
