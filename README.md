##A comical roguelike based on graduate school

This uses classical vi keybindings. When on stairs use "." to ascend or descend. Pick up the thesis with "." as well. I'll eventually have one more key use for item useage when that gets implemented.

Notes to self:

The plan is to get rid of HP and instead only use time. When you run out of time/turns until your rival uploads your thesis and plagiarizes it as his own you lose. Getting hit by enemies will decrease time remaining, but destroying certain enemies will give you time back (the idea being that you "gain control" of the virus you killed and send it to your rivals computer which slows down his upload).
