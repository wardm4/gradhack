#GradHack

A comical roguelike based on graduate school

This uses classical vi keybindings. More specifically:

* h,j,k,l,y,u,b,n for movement (use it! the game should basically be impossible if you use arrow keys)
* 0, 1, 2 for special skills
* . for doing things that appear on screen (up/down stairs, use book, use item)
* backspace to reset
* ! indicates an item
* ~ indicates a book

To run you will need pygame and python 3 (maybe earlier versions will work?). You do not need to make anything. 

Steps to play:

* Open a terminal
* type "git clone http://github.com/wardm4/gradhack" 
* type "cd gradhack"
* type "python gradhack.py"

## Note to alpha testers:

Experiment at your own risk. This is still the alpha release. If you find clear bugs that you think I might not know about, I would be ever grateful if you told me. The game has been minimally balanced.
